# Meeting-1
*Meeting Date and Time : 1st July 2018 , 1715 hours*   

## Major Elements in this Discussion
- Begin working on the research paper.
- Create 3-4 manual datasets in 2D-objective space, and check whether crowding distance metric gives expected result.
- Calculate avg. crowding disatnce in data space & objective space for original NSGA-2 and modified NSGA-2 and compare the algorithms.

## Post Meeting Job

- [x] Plot avg. crowding disatnce in data space & objective space for original NSGA-2 and modified NSGA-2.
- [x] Create 3-4 raw dataset in 2D-objective space, and check whether crowding distance metric gives expected result.
- [x] Start writing the research paper in overleaf.
